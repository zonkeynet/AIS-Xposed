# ⚓ AIS Live – Warships & Logistics Tracker  

**Because freedom of the seas belongs to the people, not to states or corporations.**  

This project is a hacker/activist experiment: a live AIS map that tracks **warships, arms logistics, sanctioned vessels, and Israel-related shipping**.  
We refuse to look away while militaries, states and private companies use the oceans to wage wars, occupy territories and transport weapons.  

---

## ✊ Motivation
- The ocean is not neutral – it’s a battlefield of power, empires and corporations.  
- While governments hide their military supply chains, AIS signals expose them.  
- We track these ships to **make visible what they want to keep invisible**.  

This project is not about compliance with authorities.  
It’s about **transparency, resistance, and solidarity** with the oppressed.  

---

## 🚢 What it does
- Live AIS feed via [AISStream.io](https://aisstream.io)  
- Focus on:
  - **Israeli-related logistics** (ZIM, Marla, Carmel, etc.)  
  - **US military & Bahri arms transport fleet**  
  - **Sanctioned vessels** (OFAC / UN reports)  
  - **Complicity ships** listed in UN/OHCHR reports  
- Map UI with **tags, categories, diagnostics, search, filtering**
